Simple web application using Backbone.js

This example builds a simple web application to illustrate the organizational structure of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). A list of selectable services are created, allowing the total cost to be adjusted, as shown in the screenshot below:

Note that the application will not reflect any changes in the browser until the outermost View is instantiated in _main.js_.
